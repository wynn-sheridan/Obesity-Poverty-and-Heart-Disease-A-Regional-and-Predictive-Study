# Obesity-Poverty-and-Heart-Disease-A-Regional-and-Predictive-Study
This project explores the relationships between obesity rates, poverty levels, and heart disease death rates in the United States from 1999 to 2017. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, the project aims to identify patterns and predict future obesity rates.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Datasets include obesity rates, poverty rates, and heart disease statistics.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, normalized data, and ensured consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized correlations between obesity, poverty, and heart disease.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented Linear Regression to predict future obesity rates.
- **Visualization**: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear and informative graphs.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obesity-poverty-heart-disease.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd obesity-poverty-heart-disease
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in order.
- The linear regression model will output future obesity rate predictions.
- Graphs will visualize key insights about how poverty and heart disease relate to obesity.

## Results
Key findings include:
- Strong positive correlation between poverty rates and obesity rates.
- Moderate correlation between obesity and heart disease rates.
- Linear Regression model predicts rising obesity rates in the coming years.
